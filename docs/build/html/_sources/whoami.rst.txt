Where am i?
***********
Just a blank place for me to post all of my thoughts on the Crypto Decisions I make. Somewhere I can direct people to when they ask me questions about Crypto or ask me to invest for them. 

I spend an exorbitant amount of time thinking about the future of crypto, investing in it, developing for it, etc. and writing down my thoughts is useful.
