<h1><strong>The Blockchain</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#the-blockchain" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="how-does-it-work">
<h2>How does it work?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-it-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The core of the blockchain relies on two things, cryptographic-security and decentralization. You may have heard the phrase “distributed ledger technology”. What that means is that the blockchain is simply a record of transactions.</p>
<p>Imagine your bank. Your bank has a database somewhere with every customer’s information including their balance. This is a centralized service, it’s all in one location. If you wanted to send money to someone else also at your bank their software simply subtracts the amount from your info in the database and adds it to someone else’s and then records the transaction information somewhere. That somewhere being a ledger of-sorts. Cryptocurrency works the same way, except distributed. This means that every person in the network has a copy of this ledger of transactions, and everytime a new transaction occurs, every copy of the ledger gets updated with it.</p>
<p>As thousands of transactions occur every second these will get bundled together into what’s known as a block. This block includes lots of transactions as well as other identifying information such as combined info from the previous block. This block gets added to the ledger history, creating what looks like a chain. The image below should help. This allows you to trace the history of every transaction and coin back to its origin point and even back to the original bitcoin transaction. Once information is on the blockchain it can never be removed. Only more added.</p>
<img alt="../_images/blockchain.png" src="../_images/blockchain.png" />
<p>When you say that you own “A bitcoin”, what that really means is that there’s a transaction line somewhere in the blockchain that says someone gave you 1 Bitcoin. There’s no actual coin or value relating to any particular coin. It is simply a notation that says you own something in theory.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="transaction-fees">
<h2>Transaction Fees<a class="headerlink" href="#transaction-fees" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Every transaction contains a transaction “fee”, a small amount added to the transaction that gets paid by the sender, to the person who adds the block to the chain. Think of it like a credit card transaction. The store you are exchanging with pays the credit card company for the ability to take cards, but with this you pay a small fee to process the transaction in exchange for the ability to use cryptocurrency. This fee is independent of the amount being sent, meaning if you send $5 or $5 million the fee should be the same. You can increase this fee to incentivize the transaction to be sent faster, or a lower one if you’re willing to wait for your transaction to be confirmed.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This video explains it very well: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4</a></p>

<h2>Security<a class="headerlink" href="#security" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="why-is-the-decentralization-superior">
<h3>Why is the Decentralization Superior?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-the-decentralization-superior" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Every time a transaction occurs it propagates throughout the network of people running it (nodes) and they come to a consensus on the current status of the network after every transaction. This is better for security because while a hacker would only have to infiltrate one server at a bank to steal your money, to hack the blockchain they would have to infiltrate thousands of machines at once to create false transaction records. When no one person controls the system, no one person can cause chaos and destroy everything.</p>

<div class="section" id="does-this-mean-that-cryptocurrency-is-unhackable">
<h3>Does this mean that cryptocurrency is unhackable?<a class="headerlink" href="#does-this-mean-that-cryptocurrency-is-unhackable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>NO</strong> it doesn’t. While the underlying technology that allows the network to function is mathematically solid right now, hacks occur all the time on people that own cryptocurrency to steal your funds. Much like someone who steals your phone has access to your credit card info and can make false purchases, someone who steals your crypto wallet information can steal your crypto. However, with enough practical security measures and common sense you should be more than protected. The weakest part of this system is human error.</p>

<p>Kind of. In order to buy Cryptocurrency you’ll need to go through an exchange and set up a wallet.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-a-cryptocurrency-wallet">
<h3>What is a Cryptocurrency Wallet?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-cryptocurrency-wallet" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The crypto wallet is the way you interact with the blockchain and send transactions. Without going into too much detail, your wallet is an encryption key that you use to prove that you are the owner of certain coins. The wallet software will take the key and do a lot of math to send and verify the transaction for you. It’s similar to how Venmo deals with your money, you don’t need to know how it works, just your info to log into your account.</p>
<p>When you create a wallet, it will generate the key for you in the form of a “mnemonic phrase”. This is a 12 or 24 grouping of words that the software uses to generate the keys. Write this down and keep it somewhere safe. With these words you can use any wallet software and access the funds but if you lose it, it’s gone <strong>FOREVER</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">witch</span> <span class="pre">collapse</span> <span class="pre">practice</span> <span class="pre">feed</span> <span class="pre">shame</span> <span class="pre">open</span> <span class="pre">despair</span> <span class="pre">creek</span> <span class="pre">road</span> <span class="pre">again</span> <span class="pre">ice</span> <span class="pre">least</span></code></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The wallet also generates what’s known as your address. It’s the identifier associated with your wallet, except unlike venmo where it’s a human readable word, it’s a long string of numbers and letters. The exact format will vary based on the coin you’re using but it should look something like this.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0xaB5409b0E5a66AcC9D63f668414539A60a5917C1</span></code></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>When someone wants to send you money you just give them that address and they send it there. Most if not all wallets will also give you the option to generate a QR-Code for the person to scan. If you want to make a transaction you just scan the code and select the amount and you’re off to the races.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/qrcode.png"><img alt="../_images/qrcode.png" src="../_images/qrcode.png" style="width: 120pt;" /></a>
<p>Since the blockchain is public and add-only, anyone can view your address’ current balance and the history of all transactions it’s ever done. Just go to a website such as</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://etherscan.io/">Ethereum Blockchain Explorer</a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/">Bitcoin Blockchain Explorer</a>.</p>
<p>And type in your address to see the full history.</p>
