<h1>Coin Suggestions<a class="headerlink" href="#coin-suggestions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>If you’ve kept reading to this point congratulations, as you finally have enough information for me to give you my recommendations on which coins to buy. I give you all the prior information so that you have the tools to research these on your own and know what to look for.</p>
<p>Before reading I have to restate this again: <strong>I am not a financial advisor. This is NOT financial advice. You are taking a financial risk I am not liable for any losses you may incur while trading due to reading this website.</strong></p>
<p>I plan on doing a deep dive on these in later posts but this is my short version introduction to each of them.</p>
<div class="section" id="big-coins">
<h2>Big Coins<a class="headerlink" href="#big-coins" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Ethereum (ETH)</dt><dd><p>See Above. I also think that they’re primed for a big expansion in the next few years. Ethereum is currently undergoing a massive upgrade to something called “Eth 2.0”. This is a massive undertaking where they will switch from being Proof of Work Based to Proof of Stake consensus algorithm. It also includes updates such as something called Sharding, which will increase the transactions per second possible on the blockchain as well as many other community scaling ventures like Rollups and SNARK’s. You don’t need to know what those words mean just that they’re new technology meant to help increase the capabilities of the network.</p>

<div class="section" id="smaller-coins">
<h2>Smaller Coins<a class="headerlink" href="#smaller-coins" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Monero (XMR)</dt><dd><p>A token focused on privacy over all else. CryptoCurrencies like Bitcoin and ethereum are actually pseudo-anonymous. This means that your transactions can be linked back to your real world identity. For example, when you send Bitcoin from an exchange to an address, the exchange keeps records of you sending it somewhere. If certain addresses are public knowledge because you disclose it somewhere, then it’s possible to trace transactions back to you. Companies and governments are already working on ways of de-anonymizing these transactions. Monero solves this by obscuring all parts of the transaction from outside viewers. In a Monero transaction the sender, the amount sent, and the recipient are all hidden to any outside observers and completely anonymous. It is based on Proof of work, similar to Bitcoin but does include a robust community and several possible solutions to increase efficiency. Market Cap - $5.8 Billion.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Polkadot (DOT)</dt><dd><p>A Crypto created by a former creator of ethereum Dr. Gavin Wood meant to facilitate a multi-chain world. Its protocols allow info exchange between MANY different blockchains such as trading Ethereum -&gt; Monero or Bitcoin -&gt; Ethereum in one transaction. It is its own coin and its own chain but it’s main use is for inter-chain operability which means it grows alongside all other coins without jockeying for market share.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Nano (NANO)</dt><dd><p>All about Energy Efficiency and Speed. It has 99% Less energy Consumption than Bitcoin that allows the entire network to be run from a single wind turbine. This is done by a system where you verify your own transactions, which creates 0-fees and near instantaneous confirmations. Its Market Cap is $714 Million which is very Low in the Crypto World and Could at LEAST go $20-25. Has an all-time high at $32</p>
</dd>
<dt>VeChain (VET)</dt><dd><p>Combines QR Codes and Asset Tracking with Blockchain permanence and transparency to Protect Against Counterfeiters &amp; Ensure transparency in Shipping. Imagine walking into a store and scanning a QR code. It then scans the blockchain to get all the information about every step in the journey your product took to get to you to ensure its authenticity and safety. It has Major Institutional Backers – Walmart China, PWC, H&amp;M, BMW, etc. It has major Consumer use cases and scalability that allow consumers to reap blockchain technology benefits without having to use actual currency.</p>

<div class="section" id="tokens">
<h2>Tokens<a class="headerlink" href="#tokens" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Chainlink (LINK)</dt><dd><p>The most popular Ethereum Oracle Program currently in use. I covered Oracles above but it’s the fastest growing one and an integral part of many decentralized Applications.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Basic Attention Token (BAT)</dt><dd><p>Created by Brendan Eich, Founder of Mozilla and Firefox, BAT Native Ethereum Token of the Brave Browser. The Brave Browser is built on the Chromium Engine making it compatible with all extensions, but with all the ad-tracking software removed to make it run more efficiently and privately. It also includes built in ad-blocking software. It’s value comes from its re-design of the ad process. In our current system when you go to a website and see an ad, the person running the ad pays google to display it and the website gets the profits. Under Brave, it cuts out google and <strong>YOU</strong> get rewarded for seeing ads. Companies advertise with Brave in showing you ads. You can turn on the feature that shows you a very limited number of ads in the form of subtle banners in the corner of your screen. Every time you see an ad the browser rewards <strong>YOU</strong> with BAT token in exchange for your viewing. You can use this to support creators and websites you like on platforms like Github, Twitter, Reddit, etc. or just hold it and exchange it for other cryptocurrencies. As of right now it occupies a very small portion of the browser market but that’s because it’s very competitive. However, it is the fastest growing browser in the world and superior to chrome in every way and once people learn about the idea of being paid for viewing ads they’re already seeing it’s a no-brainer to switch.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Uniswap (UNI)</dt><dd><p>The Governance token of the Uniswap Protocol. Uniswap is the core of decentralized finance. It allows you to swap Ethereum and thousands of tokens for one another in a decentralized way with no middle-man and low fees. Normal exchanges operate on the Order book model, connecting buyers and sellers. Because of the way the blockchain works, this is not a good model for Cryptocurrency. Decentralized exchanges like Uniswap utilize the liquidity pool model, where people provide their tokens as liquidity for exchanges in exchange for fees. Let’s say I provide liquidity for a pool exchanging Ether for Chain Link. I provide equal amounts of both of them and wait for someone to swap one for another. When making a transaction, 0.03% of the transaction value is paid as a fee to the liquidity providers, distributed based on your percentage of pool ownership and paid in this token. Ownership allows you to vote on things like changing the transaction fees, creating new liquidity pools, etc. There is currently around ~$9 Billion in liquidity locked in Uniswap with about ~$1.2 Billion in daily transaction volumes, and roughly 20% of all ethereum transaction fees being spent daily on Uniswap, making it an integral part of the ecosystem.</p>
</dd>
<dt>MerchantToken (MET)</dt><dd><p>An ICO going on right now. One of the benefits credit and debit cards have over CryptoCurrency is the ability to charge back in case of things like theft, as all CryptoCurrency transactions are final and irreversible once completed. MerchantToken seeks to build a platform that does two things: Point of Service Terminals for businesses and Escrow Services for E-Commerce. For In-person businesses they’re building software and terminals to ease the process of accepting CryptoCurrency over credit cards at the point of service. If you’re a business accepting Crypto is a great idea. This is because they pay a fee (usually of something like 1%) to the card companies to accept them, this extra cost being passed onto the consumer. By accepting CryptoCurrency the customer pays for the ability to use it, and the savings are passed onto the consumer. The escrow services are fantastic too for e-commerce. You send your money to the escrow contract and it holds it until both sides agree to release the funds without dispute, kind of like eBay. In the event of things like disputes it offers a variety of services including dispute mechanisms and Oracle Services to resolve them, releasing the funds back to the customer if ultimately necessary and penalizing the seller through the use of things like approval ratings and penalties.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Decentraland (MANA)</dt><dd><p>A blockchain based video game combining NFT’s and its own native currency. Imagine VR-Chat meets Blockchain. In Decentraland your account is tied to your ethereum address. There are plots of land, much like in minecraft. Each plot is represented by an NFT token that can be sold on the open market. You can buy and sell things and play games and do activities by spending the native token MANA. It’s currently still early in production with VR capabilities still a while away but the investment community is very excited about it and it has a lot of potential.</p>

<div class="section" id="eth-killers">
<h2>“Eth Killers”<a class="headerlink" href="#eth-killers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>” <strong>So I’ve heard a lot of buzz about these so-called Ethereum-Killers like Cardano and Eos, Should I buy them?”</strong></p>
<p>That’s a tough question with no definitive answer. Nobody really knows if they’re gonna be able to overcome anything ethereum has built. It’s possible that they could and it’s possible they could go nowhere. The reason that people claim they would be “eth-killers” is their scalability and low fees.</p>
<p>It is true that at the moment blockchains like Solana and Eos have lower fees, but that comes from the fact that less people are using them. Ethereum has high fees because every developer is using it as the base of their applications and so they’re fighting for block space. While some developers are using Solana or Eos for their applications, it’s nowhere near as many people using ethereum which means that the desire for block space is much lower, and thus lower fees under an auction model.</p>
<p>It’s a very real possibility that as those platforms grow and more people use them they will encounter very similar problems to Ethereum in terms of scalability. Another important factor is the Scalability Trilemma, which I’ve described above. The chains that have claims of higher scalability have done so by sacrificing Decentralization. For example, chains like EOS and the Binance Smart Chain use a “delegated proof-of-stake” (DPoS) consensus model where only a few privileged users are able to add blocks to the chain. This increases throughput as those block producers can run more sophisticated hardware to increase processing speed, but requires placing your trust in more centralized actors.</p>
<p>Ethereum chooses a regular Proof-Of-Stake model that allows anyone to become a block producer. This reduces the speed but increases centralization and security by making it harder for a malicious actor to control the network. Given as these coins have prices and market-caps nowhere near that of Ethereum at the moment, a smart investment strategy would be to hedge your bets by purchasing slight stakes in several of them, diversifying your portfolio and minimizing your large exposure to a single coin.</p>
