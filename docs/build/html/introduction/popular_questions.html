<h1>Most Popular Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#most-popular-questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><strong>The Conversation I have a lot:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>“Hey I wanna buy Bitcoin, how do I do that?”</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Me:</strong> Do you have any idea what Cryptocurrency is or how it works?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Them:</strong> No.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Me:</strong> Then why are you investing in it?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Them:</strong> Because the price keeps going up and I want to make money.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Me:</strong> You have no idea what you're doing. Would you throw all your money at a stock you've never heard of cause some random person told you to? No. Do some research and find out what the deal is before blindly YOLOing your money.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, this is not a good way of investing. So let's go through some of the most popular questions so you can get a better understanding of this.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-it">
<h2>What is it?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Cryptocurrencies are a class of assets much like every other currency in the world, except entirely digital. It's private, decentralized, permissionless, and entirely virtual. It only exists as computer code on the blockchain.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="but-what-does-that-mean">
<h2>But What does that mean?<a class="headerlink" href="#but-what-does-that-mean" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Privacy</strong> - It's like cash, where the only people who know the transaction is occurring is you and the person you're transacting with. It's not totally anonymous, as your transactions are public but the identity of the people transacting is private.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Decentralized</strong> - Where most countries have a central bank and a government that handles monetary policy such as issuing new currency, no single entity owns or handles the cryptocurrency. This prevents any one person or entity from messing up the economics or causing chaos and is substantially better for security.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Permissionless</strong> - Much like cash, you are in control of your own finances. You don't need to rely on anyone else and can do with it what you please without interference.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="isn-39-t-this-stuff-just-used-by-criminals-to-buy-drugs-and-launder-money">
<h2>Isn't this stuff just used by Criminals to buy drugs and launder money?<a class="headerlink" href="#isn-39-t-this-stuff-just-used-by-criminals-to-buy-drugs-and-launder-money" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>There are people doing that yes, but the vast majority of people are not. According to various researchers, the most common source of money laundering and illicit purchases is still the US Dollar.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="does-this-mean-the-us-govt-is-going-to-ban-it">
<h2>Does this mean the US Govt. is going to ban it?<a class="headerlink" href="#does-this-mean-the-us-govt-is-going-to-ban-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I don't know. They could, but I am INCREDIBLY skeptical that they will. They could try, but they won't be successful. Much like Prohibition it would be near impossible to enforce as no one person owns all the Crypto or is responsible for it and they simply can't just go around and arrest all the people who own it, it would be near if not impossible. There's also the fact that it presents too much economic potential, and the govt. knows that if they decide to oppose it, all the companies currently setting up shop here are gonna just go overseas to places like Israel, EU, Russia, and China that are much more friendly to it. They won't take that risk.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ok-so-if-i-buy-this-is-the-price-going-to-go-up">
<h2>Ok so if I buy this is the price going to go up?<a class="headerlink" href="#ok-so-if-i-buy-this-is-the-price-going-to-go-up" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>I DON'T KNOW</strong>. Nobody in the world knows what's going to happen. It could lose 50% of its value tomorrow (although unlikely) or it could go up 100%, by investing in this you're taking a financial risk akin to investing in the stock market or anything else. <strong>I am not a financial advisor, Nothing said here is financial advice and i am NOT liable for anything if your investments lose money.</strong> I make my decisions based on the information available to me and try to be as informed and educated as I can, and you should as well.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="so-then-why-should-i-buy-it">
<h2>So then why should I buy it?<a class="headerlink" href="#so-then-why-should-i-buy-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Because it's an interesting piece of technology that I think has the potential to radically change the world and our understanding of finances. It could go up 1000x or it could go to 0 and we're all in the poor house. Read through the rest of this document and you may start to see that this technology isn't going anywhere because of what it offers.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ok-i-39-m-in-so-what-do-i-do">
<h2>Ok I'm in so what do I do?<a class="headerlink" href="#ok-i-39-m-in-so-what-do-i-do" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Hold your horses, don't just invest in things you don't understand cause you're eager and full of FOMO (fear of missing out). That's how you end up losing it all. Let's talk about the underlying technology first.</p>
</div></blockquote>
