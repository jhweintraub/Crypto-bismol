<h1>Securing your investment<a class="headerlink" href="#securing-your-investment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Cryptocurrency’s arguably greatest asset, permissionlessness, is also its great weakness. Human Error is often the weakest part of any security system. Without taking proper setps to protect yourself, you could be at great risk.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-risk">
<h2>The risk<a class="headerlink" href="#the-risk" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since sending cryptocurrency doesn’t require any external users’ permission, it can be easy for malicious actors to steal it. This is achieved by sending your funds to a malicious users’ wallet. Once this happens, it’s gone forever. This is due to the blockchain’s irreversibility.</p>
<p>The way they do this is constantly evolving and subject of heavy research. However, with some simple tips you can protect yourself.</p>
<p>In order for someone to steal your cryptocurrency they have three options: wallet infiltration, extortion, and poor exchange security.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wallet-security">
<h2>Wallet Security<a class="headerlink" href="#wallet-security" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you keep your coins off an exchange, then keeping them safe from intruders is paramount. The level of security is dependent on you and how many coins you are trying to secure. It’s up to you but if you’re protecting $1M of coins, extra precautions are probably necesarry.</p>
<p>I may do a much longer post on this when I talk about Ethereum at length, but for now let me go through the types of wallets. The one you use should depend on your circumstance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wallet-types">
<h2>Wallet Types<a class="headerlink" href="#wallet-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Cold Wallet</dt>
<dd>Cold storage is an offline wallet used for storing cryptocurrency. With cold storage, the digital wallet is stored on a platform that is not connected to the internet. This protects the wallet from unauthorized access, cyber hacks, and other vulnerabilities an internet-connected system is vulnerable to. It includes things such as Paper Wallets, to store your crypto long-term. This is similar to a long-term bank account. The cold wallet is merely a message for storing cryptocurrency keys. This means that even if you use it, you can still send cryptocurrency from somewhere else at any time. You would have to recover your cold wallet to access it afterwards however.</dd>
<dt>Hot Wallet</dt>
<dd>A hot wallet is a piece of software, connected to the internet, used to send cryptocurrency. A hot wallet includes things like Mobile and Browser wallets, as they are readily available and pre-loaded with your encryption keys. These are recommended for cryptocurrency that you plan on spending, much like keeping cash in your physical wallet.</dd>
<dt>Mobile/Browser Wallet</dt>
<dd>A piece of software on your phone/computer that lets you easily send cryptocurrency and interact with decentralized applications. For Bitcoin this includes applications such as <a class="reference external" href="https://wallet.bitcoin.com/">Bitcoin.com Wallet</a>. For Ethereum this includes <a class="reference external" href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a>.</dd>
<dt>Paper Wallet</dt>
<dd>A form of cold wallet, used to store your cryptocurrency long-term. It is a physical entity that contains the instruction information needed to access your crypto in a hot wallet. It may contain your private-key, your mnemonic-seed phrase, etc. Many people write this on a piece of paper and put it somewhere secret. However, there are many products that will allow you to physically imprint it on a piece of metal, to water and fire-proof it.</dd>
<dt>Hardware Wallet</dt>
<dd>A special kind of hot-wallet to store your crypto on a physical, and easily available, device. These are typically supplemental devices to accompany mobile/browser wallets. They store your cryptocurrency keys and are used as 2-factor-authentication devices for your cryptocurrency. Imagine a small flash-drive sized object on your keychain. When you want to send cryptocurrency, you first send a request to the device. This device has encrypted and stored your keys, and will use them to initiate your requested transaction upon confirmation. This adds an extra layer of in-person security much like google-2fa. The most popular include <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ledger.com/">Ledger Nano</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://trezor.io/">Trezor Hardware Wallet</a>.</dd>
<dt>Multi-signature Wallet</dt>
<dd>This is a special kind of wallet, available on a variety of blockchains in different ways. It’s an address that can be used to send and receive crypto. However, it requires the authorization of multiple other wallets before sending. When you send a cryptocurrency transaction, your wallet creates what’s called a “digital signature”, a cryptographic proof that you are the owner of certain coins. For normal wallets, this one signature is all you need to send a transaction. For multi-signature wallets this requires the input and approval of multiple addresses/wallets before initiating a transaction. This is orders of magnitude more secure because it would require an attacker infiltrating multiple wallets or extorting multiple people to steal the coins.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preventing-extortion">
<h2>Preventing Extortion<a class="headerlink" href="#preventing-extortion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you owned a $5M diamond, would you go around town telling everyone? Probably not, because it would put you personally at risk. Cryptocurrency works the same way. If someone robs you, no police or insurance company is going to be able to help you.</p>
<img alt="../_images/wrench_attack.png" src="../_images/wrench_attack.png" />
<p>Image Source: <a class="reference external" href="https://xkcd.com/538/">XKCD</a></p>
<p>We call this the <em>$5 wrench attack</em>. The best way to avoid this is to <strong>NOT TELL ANYONE HOW MUCH YOU HAVE</strong>. Be humble, and be private.</p>
<p>There are other things you should do. For example, if you have a very large amount of coins, consider splitting it into multiple different wallets. If something happens and you are extorted, this can help you avoid having to give up all of your keys. You could also consider placing it into a multi-signature wallet, and distributing the keys to multiple places/people you trust. Just be very careful with who you trust, and the ways they store it. Many large corporations and Non-Profit-Foundations use multi-sig wallets controlled by high ranking executives.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exchange-security">
<h2>Exchange Security<a class="headerlink" href="#exchange-security" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is probably the easiest, but also entails a lot of trust and risk. Much like your banking or email, use a very strong password. Do use 2-factor authentication, with an application like Google-Authenticator. If available, turn on white-list withdrawals. This means that the exchange will only allow withdrawals to predetermined, approved addresses. Use common sense to avoid phishing attacks. Follow all suggested procedures by your exchange.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="making-backups">
<h2>Making Backups<a class="headerlink" href="#making-backups" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are hundreds, if not thousands, of stories of people losing the keys to their bitcoin, and rooting around in the trash. This is a very common problem. If you lose your keys, even with all of the computing power on earth running 24-hours a day, you would not be able to brute-force recover them, before the death of the sun.</p>
<p>That being the case, making backups is important. If you keep your keys on your computer, you should 100% keep them encrypted, and only decrypt them when you need it. Encrypted password managers like <a class="reference external" href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a>, are great for this. Using the cloud is also on option. This can include private encrypted email addresses or cloud storage. Just make sure to encrypt it before uploading.</p>
<p>Consider using a paper wallet backup for any crypto-addresses you may use as well. If you’re using long term-storage consider having 2 or 3 backups in various locations, stored with people and locations you trust. It is slightly more expensive, but buying a specialized metal-imprint is advised, to keep it fire and water proof. Consider buying a locked and hidden storage unit such as a safe or lock-box.</p>
<p>Some people have suggested getting a safe-deposit box at your local bank. This is an option, although it entails the risk of the bank locking you out of your own assets, making it worthless.</p>
<p>If you plan on a mix of both saving and spending, you should have one wallet meant for long-term storage, and one meant for everyday use.</p>
<p>This next part is a bit dark, but it <strong>essential</strong>. <strong>Make sure there is someone else who knows how to access your crypt, should you be unable</strong>. Accidents and unforseen events happen all the time. You may be saving for you and your spouse’s retirement, but if you die unexpectedly, and they can’t access it, it’s as good as gone. Be sure to have a serious conversation with someone you trust about what to do if you were gone. Tell them where to find the keys, how to load them into a wallet, how to send it to an exchange, and how to convert it to your native currency. Then write it all down.</p>
<p>I’m sure this all sounds kind of paranoid and dark. It can be, to an extent. But a little planning can prevent a major catastrophe. It’s no different than preventing yourself from being mugged. If you follow basic procedures and don’t act stupid, you will be alright.</p>
<p><strong>I am not liable for any losses you may incur through improper storage and distribution of your cryptocurrency. Invest and store at your own risk</strong></p>
